Title:
* Template for showing autorefinement

all lengths multiplied by 1 to convert to meters
Total number of filaments before multipole refine: 216
DivideSegs: Warning: tried to divide an indivisable segment.
  Segment length: 5.250000,  maximum allowed length: 2.651250  The segment is probably part of a ground plane.
  If so, decrease the partitioning level by 1 or refine the ground plane
Total number of filaments after multipole refine: 216
